      "What a great question!\n",

      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century. The shorter blue wavelengths are scattered in every direction and reach our eyes from all parts of the sky, making it appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere.\n",
      "2. The light encounters tiny molecules of gases (N2 and O2).\n",
      "3. These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\n",
      "4. Shorter wavelengths (blue) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red).\n",
      "5. Our eyes perceive this scattered blue light as the color we see in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other factors can affect the apparent color of the sky, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor can scatter light differently, making the sky appear hazy or gray.\n",
      "* Time of day: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering more blue light and making the sky appear more red.\n",
      "* Altitude and atmospheric pressure: At higher altitudes or under different atmospheric pressures, the scattering may be affected, changing the apparent color of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in our atmosphere, a process known as Rayleigh scattering.\n"

Also, the amount of electricity generated and \\nconsumed must be equal to each other. It is in a balance. There are three energy markets in Turkey, day \\nahead , intra -day, and balancing market. In the day ahead market, supply and demand information is obtained \\nand Market Clearing Price (MCP) is created. This price is the reference price for all the markets. In the intra -\\nday market, it is the market where electri city can be bought and sold for one hour after the current time. It is \\nused to make profit from the volatility of renewable energy, and avoiding the high prices in the balancing \\nmarket. In the balancing market, the imbalance of the electricity generation a nd consumption is fixed with \\nhigh commissions. This design project focuses on players of these markets to prevent being in the balancing \\nmarket and to assist their strategies.  \\nAim of the project : (What is desired to be achieved with the design that will be  developed/suggested for the system in consideration? ) \\nThe design will provide forecasts about the upcoming movements in the markets for the players of the energy \\nmarkets.

To give an example, if the design suggests that prices go down, \\nstakeholders can sell that price to minimize their potential losses.  \\nThe needs that will be met by the des ign and the requirements of the design : (Explanation of which business and \\nstakeholder needs will be met by the proposed solution as a result of the design project and defining the basic features expe cted in the \\ndeveloped design in accordance with the need s) \\nAs a result of this design project, power plants, wholesale companies, and retail companies have an insight \\ninto what will possibly happen in the intra -day market. Thus, they develop their short -term strategy according \\nto increase their profit, or minim ize their losses. Additionally, some power plants may not generate the \\nelectricity if they find the future price is cheaper than the generation expenditures. They could buy electricity \\nfrom the market and provide that electricity to other companies.  \\nSome basic features of the design projects will be explained. A dashboard that shows the predictions of the \\nprices. It has graphs and charts. Thus, business and stakeholders can see current status and the future to study \\nthe strategy. They make comments ab out what can happen in the future. Price alerts for predictions are the \\nalerts that inform business and stakeholders to desired price levels are surpassed or fell behind. An export \\nsystem for the predictions and visualization is a need for business. Thus, they may download the results, or \\nshare the results with colleagues. In addition, they may manipulate the result in most popular file types \\nincluding .xlsx, .pdf, and .csv.  \\nFundamental system requirements of the design : (Defining the basic functions and fe atures expected in the developed design \\nin accordance with the needs defined above ) \\nMachine learning models work in the background to make the predictions. To make visualization, python \\nlibraries, including matplotlib, and seaborn, for interactive plots an d graphs are required. For the dashboard, \\ngraphical user interface (GUI) python libraries and Microsoft’s dashboard development tool Power BI are \\nrequired. To notify users about price alerts or provide price forecasts for energy markets they have an intere st, \\npython libraries that can send notifications or information mail to users. For maintaining the same \\nenvironment on multiple computers, docker microservice is a requirement. For a machine learning system to \\nwork with data flows for getting data, trainin g models and prediction our system requires an Airflow \\nmicroservice is a requirement. To export, python libraries that convert the data to pdf, reportlab library is \\nused. For manipulating the data in Excel, pandas, and polars python libraries may be utiliz ed. \\nConstraints that guide the design : (What constraints does the design operate under? For example, accessibility, aesthetics, codes, \\nconstructability, cost, ergonomics, extensibility, functionality, interoperability, legal considerations, sustainability,  manufacturability, \\nmarketability, policy, regulations, schedule, standards, sustainability or usability. )\"),\n",
